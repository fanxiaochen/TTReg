=====

TTReg —— the software package for VCC's scanning device based on turntable.

###Introduction

TTReg can be used to scan 3d objects and obtain fully constructed point cloud data, which is 
a specified software package for our particular scanning devices. 

The scanning device mainly consists of a turntable, a projector and a camera. It is based on
the principle of structured-light and the turntable setting. 

We can first get 12 special images from 12 views by efforts of turntable oand then reconstruct 
the whole 3d point cloud of the real object.
